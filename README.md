A thin wrapper around serialized data which add information of identity and version.

See [concepts](#concepts) for more details.

## Goals

- **Interoperability**: Allows different applications to work together, even if they are using different 
  versions of the data model.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure that we process the data expected model.
- **Flexibility**: You can use any serialization format you want. More details [here](#setup-your-serialization-format).
- **Performance**: A minimal overhead (encode: ~20 ns, decode: ~40 ps). More details [here](#performance).

## Usage

```
            Application 1 (DotV1)                     Application 2 (DotV1 and DotV2)
                       |                                          |
          Encode DotV1 |----------------------------------------> | Decode DotV1 to DotV2
                       |                                          | Modify DotV2
          Decode DotV1 | <----------------------------------------| Encode DotV2 back to DotV1
                       |                                          |
```


```rust,skt-main
// Application 1
let dot = DotV1(1, 2);
let bytes = native_model::encode(&dot).unwrap();

// Application 1 sends bytes to Application 2.

// Application 2
// We are able to decode the bytes directly into a new type DotV2 (upgrade).
let (mut dot, source_version) = native_model::decode::<DotV2>(bytes).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dot, DotV2 { 
    name: "".to_string(), 
    x: 1, 
    y: 2 
});
dot.name = "Dot".to_string();
dot.x = 5;
// For interoperability, we encode the data with the version compatible with Application 1 (downgrade).
let bytes = native_model::encode_downgrade(dot, source_version).unwrap();

// Application 2 sends bytes to Application 1.

// Application 1
let (dot, _) = native_model::decode::<DotV1>(bytes).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dot, DotV1(5, 2));
 ```

When to use it?
- Your applications that interact with each other are written in Rust.
- Your applications evolve independently need to read serialized data coming from each other.
- Your applications store data locally and need to read it later by a newer version of the application.
- Your systems need to be upgraded incrementally. Instead of having to upgrade the entire system at once, individual
  applications can be upgraded one at a time, while still being able to communicate with each other.

When not to use it?
- Your applications that interact with each other are **not all** written in Rust.
- Your applications need to communicate with other systems that you don't control.
- You need to have a human-readable format. (You can use a human-readable format like JSON wrapped in a native model,
  but you have to unwrap it to see the data correctly.)

## Status

Early development. Not ready for production.

## Concepts

In order to understand how the native model works, you need to understand the following concepts.

- **Identity**(`id`): The identity is the unique identifier of the model. It is used to identify the model and 
  prevent to decode a model into the wrong Rust type.
- **Version**(`version`) The version is the version of the model. It is used to check the compatibility between two 
  models.
- **Encode**: The encode is the process of converting a model into a byte array.
- **Decode**: The decode is the process of converting a byte array into a model.
- **Downgrade**: The downgrade is the process of converting a model into a previous version of the model.
- **Upgrade**: The upgrade is the process of converting a model into a newer version of the model.

Under the hood, the native model is a thin wrapper around serialized data. The `id` and the `version` are twice encoded with a [`little_endian::U32`](https://docs.rs/zerocopy/latest/zerocopy/byteorder/little_endian/type.U32.html). That represents 8 bytes, that are added at the beginning of the data.

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------------------------+
|     ID (4 bytes) | Version (4 bytes)| Data (indeterminate-length bytes)  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------------------------+
```

## Setup your serialization format

First, you need to set up your serialization format. You can use any serialization format.

Just define the following functions, so they must be imported in the scope where you use the native model.

```rust,ignore
fn native_model_encode_body<T>(obj: &T) -> Result<Vec<u8>, E> {
   ...
}

fn native_model_decode_body<T>(data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<T, E> {
   ...
}
```

With `T` and `E` the type depending on the serialization format you use. Just `E` need to implement the `std::error::Error` trait.

Examples: 
- [bincode with encode/decode](./tests/example/encode_decode/bincode.rs)
- [bincode with serde](./tests/example/encode_decode/bincode_serde.rs)


## Setup your data model

Define your model using the macro [`native_model`](file:///home/vincentherlemont/IdeaProjects/native_model/target/doc/native_model/attr.native_model.html).

Attributes:
- `id = u32`: The unique identifier of the model.
- `version = u32`: The version of the model.
- `from = type`: Optional, the previous version of the model.
    - `type`: The previous version of the model that you use for the From implementation.
- `try_from = (type, error)`: Optional, the previous version of the model with error handling.
    - `type`: The previous version of the model that you use for the TryFrom implementation.
    - `error`: The error type that you use for the TryFrom implementation.

```rust,skt-define-models
use native_model::native_model;

#[derive(Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Debug)]
#[native_model(id = 1, version = 1)]
struct DotV1(u32, u32);

#[derive(Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Debug)]
#[native_model(id = 1, version = 2, from = DotV1)]
struct DotV2 {
    name: String,
    x: u64,
    y: u64,
}

// Implement the conversion between versions From<DotV1> for DotV2 and From<DotV2> for DotV1.

#[derive(Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Debug)]
#[native_model(id = 1, version = 3, try_from = (DotV2, anyhow::Error))]
struct DotV3 {
    name: String,
    cord: Cord,
}

#[derive(Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Cord {
    x: u64,
    y: u64,
}

// Implement the conversion between versions From<DotV2> for DotV3 and From<DotV3> for DotV2.
```

## Performance

Native model has
been designed to have a minimal and constant overhead. That means that the overhead is the same
whatever the size of the data. Under the wood we use the [zerocopy](https://docs.rs/zerocopy/latest/zerocopy/) crate 
to avoid unnecessary copies.

👉 To know the total time of the encode/decode, you need to add the time of your serialization format.

Resume:
- **Encode**: ~20 ns
- **Decode**: ~40 ps

|      data size       |   encode time (ns)    | decode time (ps)        |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|         1 B          | 19.769 ns - 20.154 ns | 40.526 ps - 40.617 ps   |
|        1 KiB         | 19.597 ns - 19.971 ns | 40.534 ps - 40.633 ps   |
|        1 MiB         | 19.662 ns - 19.910 ns | 40.508 ps - 40.632 ps   |
|        10 MiB        | 19.591 ns - 19.980 ns | 40.504 ps - 40.605 ps   |
|       100 MiB        | 19.669 ns - 19.867 ns | 40.520 ps - 40.644 ps   |
